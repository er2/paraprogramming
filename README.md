# Paraprogramming
### The UNIX philosophy modernized for the citizen coder

### Paraprogramming Embraces
* The UNIX pipeline programming model
* Structured Data (JSON and XML)
* Domain-Specific Languages
* Databases
* Declarative (SQL-style) programming
* Modern shells (nushell and powershell)
* APIs
* The judicious use of GUIs to generate code, especially DSLs 
* Open Standards and Open Source
* Standard Integration Methods
* Empowering practitioners with the knowledge of how real world systems work

### Paraprogramming Eschews
* Vendor Lock-in
* text munging
* Imperative programming with general purpose programming languages unless absolutely necessary

### Name

The para in paraprogramming is a references to paramedic and paralegal. 
Paraprogramming seeks to define a consistent subset of programming 

One could debate whether paraprogramming is programming. That is a semantic argument. 
If we meet our goals, this should be a continuing source of debate. "Real" programmers 
should argue that it's too easy compared to the more difficult techniques they've
invested significant time learning. Those on the other side of the debate should be able
to make a string case that paraprogramming gets the job done.

### Citizen Coder

### Compared to typical "Learn to code" techniques

Programming is a noble and rewarding profession. If you aspire to a role such as "software developer" you should be well served
by existing computer science curricula or bootcamps. 

Paraprogramming is for individuals who can't afford to invest such a substantial amount of time
and are more results oriented. It's also intended as in introduction for those looking to get into roles
like Data Science, QA, 

Paraprogramming is also intended as an introduction to certain programming concepts. Many traditional CS curricula
as frontloaded with core programming concepts. The problem with this is that if a student bails out in the middle,
the skills and knowledge they are left with is not readily transferable.

### Novelty

> Is paraprogramming new? Why create a new word for a collection of pre-existing tools and techniques?

These techniques already existed. As did the principles, on an individual basis. 
The insight of paraprogramming though is that put together, they form a cohesive skillset that meaningfully
substitutes for a typical Computer Science skillset, while having a significantly lower barrier to entry.

One purpose of the name is to help with web searches. A programmer following the traditional path can search `python rest api`, 
but since paraprogramming is by nature a hodge-podge of various tools, a common search term is helpful.

I also hope that one day paraprogramming will be used on resumes and job descriptions.

By creating something of a brand, I also hope this will encourage developers of relevant tools 
to embrace paraprogramming principles, most often by teaching their tools to output and accept structured data.

### Solutions Engineering and Enterprise Business Applications

Paraprogramming is highly pragmnatic and solutions oriented. Therefore a paraprogramming curriculum ought to cover
an overview of existing common classes of enterprise business applications, such as ERPs, CMSs, CRMs, Wikis, ticketing
systems, and document management systems. Don't reinvent the wheel
