# Paraprogramming
### The UNIX philosophy modernized for the citizen coder

### Paraprogramming Embraces
* The UNIX pipeline programming model
* Structured Data (JSON and XML)
* Domain-Specific Languages
* Databases
* Declarative (SQL-style) programming
* Modern shells (nushell and powershell)
* APIs
* The judicious use of GUIs to generate code, especially DSLs 
* Open Standards and Open Source
* Standard Integration Methods
* Empowering practitioners with the knowledge of how real world systems work

### Paraprogramming Eschews
* Vendor Lock-in
* text munging
* Imperative programming with general purpose programming languages unless absolutely necessary

### Name

The para in paraprogramming is a references to paramedic and paralegal. 
Paraprogramming seeks to define a consistent subset of programming 

One could debate whether paraprogramming is programming. That is a semantic argument. 
If we meet our goals

### Citizen Coder

### Compared to typical "Learn to code" techniques

Programming is a noble and rewarding profession. If you aspire to a role such as "software developer" you should be well served
by existing computer science curricula or bootcamps. 

Paraprogramming is for individuals who can't afford to invest such a substantial amount of time
and are more results oriented. It's also intended as in introduction for those looking to get into roles
like Data Science, QA, 

### Novelty

> Is paraprogramming new? Why create a new word for a collection of pre-existing tools and techniques?

These techniques already existed. As did the principles, on an individual basis. 
The insight of paraprogramming though is that put together, they form a cohesive skillset that substitutes for a typical Computer Science skillset,
while having a significantly lower barrier to entry.

One purpose of the name is to help with web searches. A programmer following the traditional path can search `python rest api`, 
but since paraprogramming is by nature a hodge-podge of various tools, a common search term is helpful.

I also hope that one day paraprogramming will be used on resumes and job descriptions.

By creating something of a brand, I also hope this will encourage developers of relevant tools 
to embrace paraprogramming principles, most often by teaching their tools to output and accept structured data.

### Desiderata

Here is a list of things that ought to exist in a paraprogramming friendly world

* rss to jsonfeed command line tool
* graphql wrapper for sqlite
* sqlite-like json database
* sqlite-like xml database
* browsers generate better css selectors, specifically for ld+json
* supabase don't lowercase table names
* nushell accept string for into sqlite
