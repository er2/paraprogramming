TODO: create some sort of container or Vagrantfile or devcontainer or WSL image with all of these tools preinstalled

Ideally it would be 
1. easy to get running on all platforms
2. easy to destroy and recreate
3. runnable in the cloud
4. possible to run multiple side-by-side

May resemble a cloud-ide like Cloud9.

May resemble jupyter notebooks. (why not both?)
